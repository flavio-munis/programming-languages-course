# Project Description #

Standard ML or SML is a Multi-pardigm language, first released in 1983. It's use is very uncommon, being basically obsolete for actual projects, but it is a great platform to teach about programming principles, that's why I decide to join some of my code in a single repo.

More description about the language history can be found in it's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML). And instructions about installation and it's official documentation can be found [here](https://www.smlnj.org/index.html).

The repo struct can be described as follow:

## Course ##

All code here are from homework and extra-problems givens in the amazing course ["Programming Languages, Part A"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages?), which is a series of 3 courses lectured by Dan Brown, an awesome teacher from University of Washington.

The code will be added as I am retaken the course.

## Book ##

This section will cover all code that I write while reading ["Programming in Standard ML"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/isml/book.pdf), written by Robert Harper.

## Projects ##

The most important section, contains all personal projects written in SML/NJ that I already have made so far. Includes the following Projects:

### Substitution Ciphers ###

A Simple menu interface program that converts a text using some of the most notorious Substitution Ciphers in history, and saves its result in a text file.

* __Functions:__ Encrypt and Decrypt messages using the Following Ciphers
  * Cesar Cipher
  * Vigen√®re Cipher
* __Execution:__ In the SML/NJ Repl, execute the "main.sml" file.
